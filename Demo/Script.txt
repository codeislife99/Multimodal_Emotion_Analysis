I feel so happy today. It is a great day
for me! I am gonna get amazing grades in the PR
and the TAS and Prof Dolan are gonna
be so impressed! Life is all rainbows
and unicorns. I feel a great zeal to
work for MRSD project!
I feel relieved that our PR is going properly. 
I have never been so at peace. I love
MRSD project. I am in love with you. I had
a nice meal and I feel so contented. 
Few things put you at peace as good food 
and wine and a nice nap.
My life sucks and I suck. Nothing 
goes well here. The world is all blue 
and I am going to fail MRSD project. 
Why does integration have to be so hard
and saddening. I havent slept in so many days.
I don’t even have a life. I feel 
empty and sad. Give me a tissue.
Hi LUka! Can you pass me the cup?
The US government is imposing sanctions on
Russia. Luka bot has improved her accuracy in
detecting faces. That is unremarkable, it
is so typical. Do you think they’ll give me
a refund on the book?
UGh! You’ve been the most horrible person in the 
of the universe! You disgust me! Your face
makes me vomit! I am possitively horified at
having seen the ghost, my knees were shaking.
There is something eerily scary about that place.
